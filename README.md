JXA Path

This is a simple JXA wrapper over a little confusing official API.
It provides basic functionality to work with paths like: join, parentDirectory, basename

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is intended to be used with JXA and built using [jxa-builder](https://github.com/SebastianPilarz/jxa-builder)

```javascript
const ph = Library("jxa-path");
...
```
